# DJANGO TODO (CRUD) APP 

#### Description:
TODO app to learn crud functionality.

### Features:
1. **ADD**: can add task.
2. **EDIT**: can edit the task.
3. **MARK AS DONE**: if the task completed, then you can select the task as COMPLETED.
4. **MARK AS UNDONE**: also can select the task as undone or not completed yet after selecting as COMPLETED.
5. **DELETE**: can delete the if unnecessary from the todo list.

### Why I Chose These Tools:
- **Django**: It makes backend development easy and fast.
- **BOOTSTRAP**: It helps design the website beautifully and quickly.
- **SQLite3**: A small database that works well for small projects.
